INSY 4325 Project

---

The semester long group project will be based on applying the knowledge and skills
learned in the other courses in our undergraduate program. Self-sign-up groups have
been created on Canvas. Please form your groups and sign up to a group by 8/20.
Students who have not signed up will be randomly assigned to groups.
You can choose one of the project types from the two options given below.
Option 1 (Information Systems): Full-stack design and implementation of an information
system. Pick an information systems application of your choice Think of either any
existing or new real-world application (either desktop, web-based, or mobile) and design
and implement both the front end (including user interface and problem domain
program logic) and back end (including database). The problem domain program/layer
should be implemented in Java. The project should consist of the following components:
1. Description of the problem domain
2. Functional Requirements
3. User Interface Layout/Design
4. Class Diagram
5. Database Diagram
6. Actual Implementation
Option 2 (Business Analytics): Implementation of a predictive analytics system based on
a data set. Pick a data set of your choice (either a data set from your work or from one of
the data repositories listed below), and design and implement both the training module
as well as the deployment of the model learned. The training module should provide
options for data cleaning, visualization, and predictive model learning using at least 3
different machine learning algorithms. It should provide a comparative analysis of the
performance of the three models and allow the user to choose the model to deploy. The
system should be able to use the deployed model to predict the target variable for new
instances. The training module as well as the deployed model should be implemented in
Python. The project should consist of the following components:
1. Description of the problem domain including details about the data
2. User Interface Layout/Design
3. Data Cleaning techniques
4. Visualization techniques
5. Data Mining algorithms
6. Actual Implementation

Midterm Project Presentation:
Midterm presentations will be held on 9/29 â€“ 10/8 and should cover parts 1-5.
Final Project Presentation:
Final presentations will be held on 11/10-11/19 and should include a demo of the
implemented system.
Final Project Report:
The final project report, due by 12/8, should contain the above 6 components together
with the actual code files.
